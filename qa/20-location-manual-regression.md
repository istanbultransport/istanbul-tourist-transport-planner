# 50-place / 40-route manual regression

## Purpose
Run a controlled no-paid-API regression pass before deciding whether to integrate Google Places. Dataset: `qa/location-regression-cases.json` (50 places, 40 route scenarios).

## Coverage and limits
- 46 entries match the current in-app place catalogue by ID/name and have the catalogue's stored coordinates.
- Three business records are integrated into the in-app catalogue and route selection: Four Seasons Hotel Istanbul at Sultanahmet, Karaköy Lokantası and Çiya Sofrası. Their coordinates are cross-checked but have not been field-surveyed. Faros Karaköy remains excluded from production selection because its point is approximate; it stays a non-runnable gap probe.
- This dataset is a **test plan**; CI verifies the source and a browser QA page exercises the 40 route fixtures. Hosted-browser/field validation is still required before claiming production readiness.
- Do not invent coordinates, station choices, walking times, or ETAs. Verify business identity and route details against reliable current sources during execution.
- A test passes only after it is performed in the deployed browser and its visible output is checked. Static QA alone does not prove live interaction works.

## Execution order
1. Record deployed build ID and confirm it matches the intended GitHub commit.
2. Open the live app in a fresh browser session; record whether place cards and search are visible.
3. For each route case R01–R40, set the origin and destination, calculate the route, and record the actual result.
4. Verify origin/destination identity, coordinates or place ID handoff, selected station, transfers, pier/exit instructions, walking time, and error handling.
5. Repeat the route with origin/destination reversed when meaningful.
6. Test clear/reset, rapid repeated search, and mobile layout.
7. Fix each failure, rerun the failed case, then rerun all 40 cases as regression.
8. Separately test PWA cache/offline behavior after route regression passes.

## Result record
For every case record: PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED, build ID, screenshot, selected origin/destination, selected station(s), transfers, walking minutes, console errors, source used to verify expected result, and a short defect description.

## Release gate
Do not call the route system production-ready while any critical origin/destination selection, route calculation, wrong-station, broken tab/search, or stale-cache regression remains unresolved. Mark unverified live tests as BLOCKED rather than PASS.
